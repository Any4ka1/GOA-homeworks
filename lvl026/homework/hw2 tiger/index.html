    <p><i>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</i></p>

    <p><i>The tiger is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support its prey requirements. The tiger is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 metres (11.1 ft) in the case of the Siberian tiger, a shoulder height of up to 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) and weighing up to 306 kilograms (675 lb).
