#explain with comments what variables are, how many data types we got, how we update variables, one specific thing about bool 

#variable is a box that contains any data type info 
#we have : str(string) bool(bulion) int(integer) float(float) 
#we need to start whit capitalise letter exaple: True & False

# create different variables with different data types and output em

#int
#a = 5

#float
#b = 3.14159265359

#str
#c = "wonderhoy"
 
#bool
#d = True
#e = False

#print(a)
#print(b)
#print (c)

# given said variables update some of them and then output

#a = 67

#b = 2

#print (a)
#print (b)



#again grab those variables and now change their types

#print (type(a))
#a = float(a)
#b = int(b)
#print(a,b)




#by changing some of them use them with (all) math operators to do some math
# + - * ** / // %
